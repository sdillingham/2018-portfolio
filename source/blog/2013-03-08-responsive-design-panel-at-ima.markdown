I had the privilege of participating in a panel on responsive web design at this year's iMA conference in Austin, TX. The panel, organized by [Jack Brighton](https://twitter.com/jackbrighton) from WILL, also featured two fantastic web developers: [Erik Golts](https://twitter.com/egolts) from OPB and consultant [Sean Stewart](http://www.seankstewart.com/).

The audio from the talk is no longer available on Soundcloud, but I've  posted my slide deck (embed below). We each focused on different aspects of responsive design: Sean Stewart spoke first about responsive design fundamentals, I talked about key challenges responsive design presents to news organizations, and Erik finished off the session talking about some specific technical challenges OPB overcame in their recent responsive redesign.

This was my first time attending iMA, and it was fantastic to see so many smart people talking and thinking about the big challenges and opportunities that public media faces in the digital space.
