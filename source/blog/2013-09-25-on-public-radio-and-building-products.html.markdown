For those paying attention, it's no secret that public radio has a product problem. That is, we don't know how to build great products, and we're often confused about whether it should be part of our core mission.

Some believe that we should syndicate our work and focus on content- rather than product- innovation. Under this model, our content should be on platforms like Flipboard, iHeartRadio, and Stitcher- the more the better, it seems. But these aggregators are [not a simple transistor radio](http://mashable.com/2013/09/03/scott-pham-guest-post/). They want our content, and in exchange we get no underwriting money, no membership pipeline, and no audience data. Today's aggregators will [gladly earn the loyalty and data of our audiences](http://digitalservices.npr.org/post/public-radio-streaming-tunein-growing-faster-you-think), while we become even less than "just another station on the dial."

The lack of collective drive to build our own products in the face of this threat indicates that public radio is unaware and afraid. Unaware of how to build great audience experiences they can own (products + content working together). Afraid of swinging for the fences and finding a new loyalty-driven revenue model for the digital future. And so scared of being irrelevant they're willing to hand over some of the best audio content in the world in exchange for vapor.

There's a set of vague hopes undergirding public radio/aggregator relationships:

* We hope they'll provide us with a wider funnel to grab new audience and move them down the pipeline into loyal members.
* We hope they'll provide us with a larger audience for our streams, enabling us to increase our underwriting rates.
* We hope aggregators at some point get serious about helping us earn revenue from their products. The underlying assumption being that our sustainability is in their interest.

Unfortunately, I see little chance of these dreams coming true. I've yet to see any station-aggregator relationship that converts listeners into members. Declining digital ad rates in the news business don't bode well for underwriting growth in impressions.

And what about aggregators sharing revenue with content creators? Startups worried about their own profitability are unlikely to create meaningful revenue for public radio.

I understand the challenge: building great products is hard. But so is making great content, and in that regard we have a strategic asset we should leverage to our best advantage.

Let's get down to business and start building world-class products and experiences that we own. If public radio can do that, we can continue to own our audience and control our destiny.
