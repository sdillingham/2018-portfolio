For those paying attention, it's no secret that public radio has a product problem. That is, we don't know how to build great products, and we're often confused about whether it should be part of our core mission.

Some are pursuing a syndication strategy that focuses on content- rather than product- innovation. Under this model, our content should be on platforms like Flipboard, iHeartRadio, and Stitcher- the more the better, it seems. But these aggregators are [not a simple transistor radio](http://mashable.com/2013/09/03/scott-pham-guest-post/), and they want more than just our content - they want our audiences. Many of us in public radio give them our content freely, and in exchange we recieve no underwriting money, no membership pipeline, and no audience data.

The lack of collective drive to build our own products in the face of this threat suggests that public radio is unaware and afraid. Unaware of how to build great audience experiences they can own (products + content working together). Afraid of swinging for the fences and finding a new loyalty-driven revenue model for the digital future. And so scared of being irrelevant they're willing to hand over some of the best audio content in the world in exchange for exposure.

There's a set of vague hopes undergirding public radio/aggregator relationships:

* We hope they'll provide us with a wider funnel to grab new audience and move them down the pipeline into loyal members.
* We hope they'll provide us with a larger audience for our streams, enabling us to increase our underwriting rates.
* We hope aggregators at some point get serious about helping us earn revenue from their products. The underlying assumption being that our sustainability is in their interest.

Sadly, I see little chance of these dreams coming true. I've yet to see any station-aggregator relationship that converts listeners into members, and declining digital ad rates in the news business don't bode well for underwriting revenue.

And what about aggregators sharing revenue with content creators? It's foolish to think that startups worried about their own profitability will create meaningful revenue for public radio.

I understand the challenge: building great products is hard. But so is making great content, and our content gives us great leverage.

My hope is that we get down to business and start building world-class products and experiences that we own. If public radio can do that, we'll remain close to our audience and control our destiny.
