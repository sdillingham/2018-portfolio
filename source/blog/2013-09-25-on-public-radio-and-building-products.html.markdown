For those paying attention, it's no secret that public radio has a product problem. That is, we don't know how to build great products - or sometimes even decent ones - and often we're confused about whether building products should be part of our core mission.

Some believe that, in order to reach new audiences and fulfill our public service mission, we should syndicate and focus on conent innovation rather than product innovation. Our content should be on as many platforms as possible, including aggregators like Flipboard, iHeartRadio, and Stitcher. However, these products are [not a simple transistor radio](http://mashable.com/2013/09/03/scott-pham-guest-post/). These are competing brands who want all our valuable content for nothing (no underwriting money, no real membership pipeline, no audience data) and will [gladly earn the loyalty and data of our audiences](http://digitalservices.npr.org/post/public-radio-streaming-tunein-growing-faster-you-think) while we're relegated to an even weaker position than "just another station on the dial."

The lack of collective drive to build our own products in the face of this threat indicates that public radio is afraid: afraid of stepping up and doing what it takes to build great audience experiences they can own (which means products + content working together); afraid of swinging for the fences and finding a new, sustainable loyalty-driven revenue model for the digital future; and so afraid of being irrelevant on the internet that they're willing to hand over some of the best audio content being created in the world in exchange for little to nothing.

There's some vague hopes that seem to come along with public radio/aggregator relationships:

* We hope they'll provide us with a wider funnel to grab new audience and move them down the pipeline into loyal members.
* We hope they'll provide us with a larger audience for our streams, which we can use to increase our underwriting rates.
* We hope aggregators will, at some point, get serious about helping us earn revenue from their products, because our sustainability in their interest. 

Unfortunately, I see little hope of any of these dreams coming true. In terms of membership cultivation where the first touchpoint is an aggregator, I've yet to see anyone who has an actual audience aquisition plan that successfully converts this funnel. Growing our streaming audiences *could* help our underwriting revenues, if not for the fact that digital ad rates in the news business have been falling and don't seem to have yet hit bottom. 

As for aggregators passing on revenue to content creators, it seems unlikely that startups desperately chasing after profitability will be likely to come through with a meaningful revenue model for public radio. 

I understand the challenge: building great products is hard. But consistently creating great content is even harder, and in that respect we have a distinct advantage over aggregators.

Let's get down to business and start building world-class products and experiences we can own. If we do that, and keep making great audio, then public radio can continue to own the relationship with our audience, and our collective destiny.
