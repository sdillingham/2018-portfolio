teaser: After years of believing it was only for developers, it's become clear that Markdown is the future of web-native writing.

Are there bands you love that you rarely try to share with anyone?

I do, not because I want to keep them a secret, but because certain bands have a specific appeal. You're going to dig [Lungfish](http://www.dischord.com/band/lungfish) if you're into apocalyptic poetry set to portentious glacial riffs that repeat for five minutes straight. For most people, not so much.

Markdown, the web writing syntax [created by John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), always felt that way to me— like a great band that only a handful would appreciate. Two-and-a-half years ago, when I first started building products for a newsroom, Markdown appeared destined to be a niche web writing tool for geeks-only. I believed developers were stuck enduring HTML-based WYSIWYG editors in our publishing tools.

I was wrong. It's clear now that Markdown is the future of web-native writing.

It's going to take time, to be sure (maybe even a generation), but Markdown's popularity is exploding. Back in June, Mashable catalogued [78(!) different tools](http://mashable.com/2013/06/24/markdown-tools/) for authoring Markdown. And the momentum behind Markdown continues to grow.

I'm writing this post using Markdown via [Middleman's](http://middlemanapp.com/) blogging extension. In the past year, I've found myself using Google Docs less and less, and instead turning to three different Markdown-based editors for the majority of my writing: two web-based services Editorially (RIP) and [Draft](http://draftin.com/)), and one Mac app ([MOU](http://mouapp.com/)).

And I'm not the only one. Look at the [Google trends for searches containing “markdown”](http://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=markdown#q=markdown&cmpt=q) over the past decade:

For the first time ever, [people other than developers have discovered](https://medium.com/writers-on-writing/3fa1eacd528e) the elegance and simplicity of using Markdown to write. I'm noticing a handful of younger journalists in the KPCC newsroom not just talking about Markdown, but using it and enjoying it.

I think this younger, web-native generation of writers and journalists will turn the tide in favor of Markdown. Like Steve Jobs said about not being able to sell tablets to older users accustomed to physical keyboards: “one day we realized that death would eventually take care of this.”

Markdown sits in the early stages of a renaissance. Yes, it still has problems to overcome: an incomplete standard syntax, and different [proprietary implementations](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) trying to fill in the gaps. On top of that, developers of publishing systems have to sweat the details of parsing Markdown to HTML in elegant and performant ways.

But between these problems and the inherent clunkiness of WYSIWYG HTML editors, I'm all in for Markdown.
