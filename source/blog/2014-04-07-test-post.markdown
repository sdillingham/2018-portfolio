For those paying attention, it's no secret that public radio has a product problem. That is, we don't know how to build great products, and we're often confused about whether it should be part of our core mission.

Some believe that we should syndicate our content and focus on content rather than product innovation. Our content should be on platforms like Flipboard, iHeartRadio, and Stitcher. But these aggregators are <a href="javascript:void(0)">not a simple transistor radio</a>. They want our content, and in exchange we get no underwriting money, no membership pipeline, and no audience data. These apps will <a href="javascript:void(0)">gladly earn the loyalty and data of our audiences</a>, while we become even less than "just another station on the dial."

The lack of collective drive to build our own products in the face of this threat indicates that public radio is unaware and afraid. Unaware of how to build great audience experiences they can own (products + content working together). Afraid of swinging for the fences and finding a new loyalty-driven revenue model for the digital future. And so afraid of being irrelevant they're willing to hand over some of the best audio content in the world in exchange for vapor.

There's some vague hopes that seem to come along with public radio/aggregator relationships:

* We hope they'll provide us with a wider funnel to grab new audience and move them down the pipeline into loyal members.
* We hope they'll provide us with a larger audience for our streams, enabling us to increase our underwriting rates.
* We hope aggregators at some point get serious about helping us earn revenue from their products. The underlying assumption is that our sustainability in their interest.

Unfortunately, I see little hope of any of these dreams coming true. I've yet to see any station-aggregator relationship that converts listeners into members. Declining digital ad rates in the news business don't bode well for underwriting our stream growth.

And what about aggregators sharing revenue with content creators? Startups are too worried about their own bottom line to create meaningful revenue for public radio.

I understand the challenge: building great products is hard. But great content is what drives audience, and in that way we have a distinct advantage over aggregators.

Let's get down to business and start building world-class products and experiences that we own. If public radio can do that, we can continue to own our audience and control our destiny.

1. It is interesting to note that the earliest empires, [Assyria and Egypt](), were not naval powers, because they arose in rich river valleys abundantly capable of sustaining their inhabitants. They did not need to command the sea.
2. History, translated by Geo. Rawlinson, vol. III, p. 144.
3. A bireme is an ancient oared galley warship with two decks of oars and manned by 120 rowers. A trieme has three decks manned by approximately 170 rowers. Contrary to popular perception, rowers were not 'galley slaves' but rather free men.
