I know, I know: _Serial_ is the shit. It's grabbing all the headlines, clogging up my Twitter feed. But amid all the buzz about how podcasting has _finally arrived_, let's take a moment to bear witness to another bellwether in the sea change towards podcasts:  Roman Mars' Radiotopia just [raised over $640,000* on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1748303376/radiotopia-a-storytelling-revolution) in one month.

That is a staggering amount of money, especially when you think about it in the context of traditional public radio fundraising and Radiotopia's position in the public radio landscape. There's no such thing as a "typical" public radio station, but Radiotopia's Kickstarter compares favorably to pledge drive for large urban public radio stations. A revenue goal for a pledge drive at WBUR, WBEZ or KPCC (where I work) is somewhere in the ballpark of $1 million. No apples-to-apples comparisons exist, of course, but Radiotopia's ability to fundraise rivals or beats many public radio pledge drives. And that, I would argue, is a very big deal for the future of public radio.

 Radiotopia will soon be 10 shows strong, and has a much leaner staff than most public radio stations. They represent a more efficient model for producing great audio with far less overhead. Over 21,000 people donated to their Kickstarter, about 30-50% of the total membership of large public radio stations. And Radiotopia did all this without being on the airwaves. (Last I checked, 99% Invisible is only broadcast on 6 stations in the U.S.). Which means that Roman Mars and his crew have built a loyal audience that can sustain them, and can attribute nearly 100% of their success to podcasting.

### Admit that the waters around you have grown

If you are a traditional public radio station, you should be very worried by this news. I think we'll look back on 2014 as the year when the best audio storytellers realized that they don't need public radio to survive. _Serial_ and _99% Invisible_ have shown that it's unnecessary - maybe even unwise - to go to work for a public radio station when you could just get down to the business of making great podcasts and building a direct relationship with your audience. 

If the best audio storytellers of the next 5 years bypass public radio, the best (and most valuable) audiences will follow them. I suspect the net effect will be the creation of a deep split for the attention of younger audiences interested in what public radio offers, and ultimately an unbundling of the total value that public radio has created over the past four decades.

In my view, public radio's value can be broken down into four parts:

1. High-quality national and international news
2. Great audio storytelling
3. Compelling local content and context
4. Convening and connecting a tribe

More or less, these are the reasons people listen to - and love - public radio. Take any one of these away, and the whole thing crumbles. If all of a sudden there's a better place to get my storytelling fix - let's call it Podlandia - then the combined value of traditional public radio is reduced largely to eat-your-vegetables hard news. That's a far cry from Jad Abumrad's description of public radio's ability to   ["connect all sides of (your) being."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjh_8CoAt1M)

Go back to the _99% Invisible_ episodes that Roman Mars released during the Kickstarter campaign. Listen to the language he uses to describe his ambitions:

> "This is my final battle in the war to remake public radio into the best form of itself."

Mars and his army of 21,000 supporters have spoken, and the message to public radio is clear: you better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a stone.
