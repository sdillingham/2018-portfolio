I know, I know: "_Serial_." It's [grabbing all the headlines](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/business/media/serial-podcastings-first-breakout-hit-sets-stage-for-more.html), clogging up my Twitter feed. But amid all the buzz about how podcasting has _finally arrived_, another bellwether in the sea change towards podcasts almost slipped by unnoticed: Radiotopia, the podcast collective led by Roman Mars and "99% Invisible," just [raised over $640,000](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1748303376/radiotopia-a-storytelling-revolution) on Kickstarter.[^kickstarter]

That is a staggering amount of money, especially when you think about it in the context of traditional public radio fundraising and Radiotopia's position in the public radio landscape. Radiotopia's Kickstarter compares favorably to pledge drives for large stations like WBUR, WBEZ or KPCC (where I work), whose pledge drive goals are usually somewhere in the ballpark of $1 million. That's not an apples-to-apples comparison, but Radiotopia's ability to fundraise rivals or beats many public radio pledge drives. And that, I would argue, is a very big deal for the future of public radio.

 Radiotopia will soon be 10 shows strong, and has a much leaner staff than most public radio stations. They represent a more efficient model for producing great audio storytelling with far less overhead. Over 21,000 people donated to their Kickstarter, about 30-50% of the total membership of large public radio stations. And Radiotopia did all this without being "on the air" (99% Invisible is only broadcast on 6 stations in the U.S.). Which means that Roman Mars and his crew have built a loyal audience that can sustain them, and can attribute nearly 100% of their success to podcasting.

### Admit that the waters around you have grown

If you are a traditional public radio station, this news should worry you. I think we'll look back on 2014 as the year when the best audio storytellers realized that they don't need public radio to survive."Serial" and "99% Invisible"/Radiotopia have shown that it's unnecessary - maybe even unwise - to go to work for a public radio station when you could just get down to the business of making great podcasts and building a direct relationship with your audience. 

If the best audio storytellers of the next 5 years bypass public radio, the best (and most valuable) audiences will follow them. The net effect will be the creation of a deep split for the attention of younger audiences interested in what public radio offers, and ultimately an unbundling of the total value that public radio has created over the past four decades.

In my view, public radio's value can be broken down into four areas:

1. High-quality national and international news
2. Great audio storytelling
3. Compelling local content and context
4. Convening and connecting a tribe

Added together, these are the reasons people listen to - and love - public radio. Take any one of these away, and the whole thing crumbles. If all of a sudden there's a better place to get my storytelling fix - let's call it Podlandia - then the remaining value of traditional public radio is reduced largely to eat-your-vegetables hard news. That's a far cry from Jad Abumrad's description of public radio's ability to   ["connect all sides of (your) being."](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjh_8CoAt1M&t=24m04s)

Go back to the recent "99% Invisible" episodes that Roman Mars released during the Kickstarter campaign. Listen to the language he uses to describe his ambitions:

> "This is my final battle in the war to remake public radio into the best form of itself."

Mars and his army of 21,000 supporters have spoken. The message to public radio? You better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a stone.
