  Currently I'm a Product Designer at Signal Sciences. Prior to that I worked for five years in public radio as the Director of UX for KPCC and American Public Media.

  I've also worked for the University of California, an Idealab startup, and the San Francisco Bay Guardian. Iâ€™ve been designing digital products since 2001.

  I'm a musician, music fanatic, and lover of old films. I enjoy building better tools for people to make, publish and share creative work. I'm passionate about the future of publishing tools and journalism.

  I write [here](blog/).

  I log my design work [here](work/).

  You can also find me on [Github](http://github.com/sdillingham).
